## Projects:  
- **Autonomous Vehicles Related:**  

　**Processing: A Quantification Risk Assessment Method Based on Driving Safety Field Model for Autonomous Vehicles**  
   * Technologies used: C++, ROS, Ubuntu  
   1. Referring to recent papers on risk field in CAV field, the risk field model in these papers is reproduced.  
   2. Based on ROS, the road data of the surrounding radar and images were collected by the laboratory vehicle.  
      The information of the image and point cloud were processed by YOLO and point cloud  
      clustering respectively, and the information published by the perception part  
      was subscribed to obtain the obstacle categories and 3D coordinates.  
   3. Considering the different characteristics of obstacles such as road structure,  
      lane lines and vehicles, different mathematical models are used to construct  
      risk models respectively. Compared with the previous work of  
      others, the risk distribution was corrected by introducing the self-vehicle motion state.  
      
  　**Finished: 3D Objection Detection in LiDAR based on Deep Learning**     
   * [https://github.com/SH-Tan/voxel-rangenet](https://github.com/SH-Tan/voxel-rangenet)  
   *    Technologies used: Python, ROS, Ubuntu, Pytorch, OpenPCDet, KITTI3D  
   *    Goal: To improve the detection accuracy of small targets such as pedestrians and bicycles using LiDAR point clouds.  
   1.    Main references: Voxel-RCNN, Centerpoint, and RangerCNN.  
   2.    Investigated the main point cloud object detection algorithms and the main way of point cloud  
         feature expression. Understood the two-stage and one-stage object detection methods  
         and the concepts of RPN and FPN.  
   3.    Running voxelRCNN and Centerpoint, accuracy was aligned with paper result;  
   4.    Reproduced the backbone in RangeRCNN, combined the range and voxel feature in one network  
         to improve the accuracy of small objection.
