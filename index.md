  3.  Investigate the current model papers, and preliminarily attempt to reproduce VPFNet and SST models.




 **Finished:** LiDar point cloud Cluster and recognization                                            2022.5-2022.8
 
   1. **Technologies used:** C++,ROS,Ubuntu18.04,git,cmake

    2.Learned code standardization, extracted and reconstructed laboratory codes of original point cloud clustering and Boundingox calculation;

    3.To improve the performance of cloud clustering, 3D NMS module is added after the original Scaneline algorithm to filter out redundant boxes;

    4.Combined with high-precision map, the road ROI is extracted, and the point cloud of obstacles on the road is clustered;

    5.Reconstruct BoundingBox algorithm refers to Baidu’s algorithm, and transplants it to adapt the input and output interface of our own code.
   


  **Finished:** A Quantification Risk Assessment Method Based on Driving Safety Field Model for Autonomous Vehicles 
 
 　[https://github.com/SH-Tan/AV\_risk\_model](https://github.com/SH-Tan/AV\_risk\_model)  
   1. **Technologies used:** C++,Python,ROS,Ubuntu18.04,Matlab 
   2. **Paper under review:** RCP-RF: A Comprehensive Road-car-pedestrian Risk Management Framework based on Driving Risk Potential Field
   3. Referring to recent papers on risk field in CAV field, the risk field model in these papers is reproduced;
   4. In view of the shortage of relevant work, the proposed model considers the different characteristics of obstacles such as road structure, lane lines, vehicles and pedestrians, and adopts different mathematical models to construct risk models respectively;
   5. Compared with the previous works, the model algorithm estimated the relative motion trend of the vehicle and the obstacle vehicle using cosine similarity between the vector of position and motion direction, and corrected the risk distribution. The CCDF probability curve was used to evaluate the risk relationship of each obstacle. 
      
  　**Finished:** 3D Objection Detection in LiDAR based on Deep Learning     
   　　[https://github.com/SH-Tan/voxel-rangenet](https://github.com/SH-Tan/voxel-rangenet)  
   1.   **Technologies used:** Python, ROS, Ubuntu, Pytorch, OpenPCDet, KITTI3D  
   2.   **Goal:** To improve the detection accuracy of small targets such as pedestrians and bicycles using LiDAR point clouds.  
   3.    Main references: Voxel-RCNN, Centerpoint, and RangerCNN.  
   4.    Investigated the main point cloud object detection algorithms and the main way of point cloud  
         feature expression. Understood the two-stage and one-stage object detection methods  
         and the concepts of RPN and FPN.  
   5.    Running voxelRCNN and Centerpoint, accuracy was aligned with paper result;  
   6.    Reproduced the backbone in RangeRCNN, combined the range and voxel feature in one network  
         to improve the accuracy of small objection.
